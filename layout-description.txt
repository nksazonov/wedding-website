WEDDING WEBSITE LAYOUT DESCRIPTION
====================================

### RIGHT PANEL (Scrollable, ~40% width)
- **Position**: Takes remaining 40% of screen width on the right
- **Height**: Minimum full viewport height, extends as content requires
- **Content**: Wedding information sections
- **Behavior**: Scrollable content that triggers image changes in left panel
